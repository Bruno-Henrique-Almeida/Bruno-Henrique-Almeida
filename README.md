# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Bruno Almeida

### ðŸš€ Data Engineer | Cloud Enthusiast | Data Solutions Builder

Data Engineer, specialized in building and optimizing scalable and efficient data solutions. I have strong knowledge in languages such as Python and SQL, as well as working with SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse, Elasticsearch, Redis, Neo4j). My experience includes using tools such as Git for version control, AWS for cloud infrastructure (EC2, RDS, SNS, SQS, S3, Lambda), Docker for containerization, and Big Data expertise with Hadoop, PySpark, Flume and NiFi. I also use Kafka for real-time processing, Airflow and Dagster for pipeline orchestration, and Tableau to transform data into strategic insights.

### ðŸ¤– Fun Section â€” My First Steps into AI
Recently, I started learning more about Artificial Intelligence.  
It began as simple curiosity and quickly became one of my favorite learning topics.  

Iâ€™m exploring how AI can connect with data engineering â€” from integrating machine learning models into pipelines to experimenting with prompt engineering and LLMs.  

> Data gives us insights, AI gives it intelligence.
